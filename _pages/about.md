I received my PhD in 2023 from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia. 
I have a **BSci in Marine Biology** from the Autonomous University of Baja California Sur (BCS, Mexico). Co-founded the **DIY-bio laboratory** Laboratorios Cardon (La Paz, BCS).
